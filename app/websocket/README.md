# Websocket Adapters

## Reason for this folder:

This folder is to keep our websocket code clean and separated out. 

This is a great tool to adapt to allow access from other back-end frameworks to 
connect to LlamaBot, for example: 
- Ruby on Rails
- Laravel
- etc.

The live websocket connection that goes 2 directions will act as a bridge for our agent to run workflows and communicate with other technologies.
